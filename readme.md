# FIND A HEART

Find a heart was one of the first Unity3D projects I've done back in the day. It is a simple platform where
player should gather *all of the small hearts* to be able interact with the big heart and finish the level.
It doesn't have that many levels in it but it was fun the help of the janky controls :P.

The libraries were mostly out of date. I've reimported the project with latest version of Unity3D. **Some parts
are broken but I'll be working on that when I have time.**

*For now you inspect it game code and also download a working build from the build folder.*
